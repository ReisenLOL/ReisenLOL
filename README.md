# ABOUT
You probably found me from discord. Or maybe you came here from my Rentry which is linked on my other places. Or maybe from Itch. I'd be surprised if someone came here from there. Anyway, if you're here, you're bored enough to be reading this whole about me. This design is sorta stolen from a cool guy, sorry. I'll probably move all of this to a personal site once I learn web dev.

  - At the time of writing (7/5/25), has completed 185 days of game development, without a single day missed.
- Artist
  - Very beginner artist
  - Art is posted nowhere but discord, contact there if you want to see it
  - At the time of writing, has completed ~A WEEK???? (i lost track) of art.
  - Only draws touhou fanart. I wonder why.

- Touhou Fan
  - Absolutely loves and is attached to Touhou
  - Favorite characters are Reisen and Youmu, favorite ship is Udomyon (if it wasn't obvious enough!)
  - Got into Touhou back in 2020, but known about it a long time earlier 
- Music Composer (rarely)

- Prefers self-learning. Tutorals do not work well on her that much, as she learns best by interacting with whatever she is learning.
- Difficulty talking, so you'll sometimes notice her to be pretty quiet at times, or not responding. But she's listening, don't worry

(god it feels weird talking in third person, but the properties of sylvia listed!)
